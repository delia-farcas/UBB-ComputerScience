In the second semester, I transitioned to C++ to build on my OOP knowledge and go deeper into systems-level programming concepts. Topics covered:
- Advanced OOP principles: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Operator overloading and abstract classes
- Templates and generic programming: implementing data structures with templates
- Working with data structures such as:
  - Linked lists
  - Stacks and queues
  - Trees and graphs (introductory)
- Implementing and analyzing basic algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversal
- GUI application development using the Qt framework
