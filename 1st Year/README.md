ðŸ§  Year 1 Overview
ðŸ“Œ Semester 1 â€“ Fundamentals of Programming (Python)

In the first semester, I was introduced to the foundations of programming using Python. Key topics included:
Variables, data types, and control flow (conditions, loops)
Functions and modular programming
Basic algorithms and problem-solving
Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, encapsulation
This course laid the groundwork for structured and object-oriented thinking in code.

ðŸ“Œ Semester 2 â€“ Object-Oriented Programming (C++)

In the second semester, I transitioned to C++ to build on my OOP knowledge and go deeper into systems-level programming concepts. Topics covered:
Advanced OOP principles: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
Operator overloading and abstract classes
Templates and generic programming: implementing data structures with templates
Working with data structures such as:
  Linked lists
  Stacks and queues
  Trees and graphs (introductory)
  Implementing and analyzing basic algorithms for sorting, searching, and traversal
  GUI application development using the Qt framework
